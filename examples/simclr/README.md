# Overview

Here is an example of applying PreAct-ResNet18 to train SimCLR on CIFAR10. We use 1x RTX 3090 in this example. Note that data augmentation strategies used are a little bit different from the origianl SimCLR paper. Scripts for applying ResNet50 to train SimCLR on ImageNet-1K are also provided but not evaluated. 

# How to run
Specified in:
```shell
bash train.sh
```
